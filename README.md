## Solution and Results

Past matched data were used to predict the final game ranking in PUBG. Several models were constructed and optimised including Linear Regression, Lasso and Elastic-Net, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Models for prediction. By comparing the test RMSE (Root Mean Square Erro), Gradinet Boosting Moldel was chosen as the final prediction model, which achived the minimal test RMSE at 0.08999413.
